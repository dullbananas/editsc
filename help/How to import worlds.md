# Importing worlds


## iOS and iPadOS

Unfortunately, Survivalcraft not have integration with Files, so this is slightly hard. The only way to do this is with Dropbox.

You will have to do this once:

1. Get a dropbox account.
2. Sign in to Dropbox in Survivalcraft. Go to Content then Private, and log in there.
3. Install the Dropbox app and sign in there.
4. Make Dropbox available in Files. Open the Files app, and go to the Browse menu (this is a sidebar on iPad and on iPhone just press back until you see it). Select the 3 dots button on the top right of this menu and tap "Edit". Turn on the switch next to "Dropbox".

Whenever you want to be able to edit a world you have in Survivalcraft, do this:

5. Upload the world to Dropbox. In Survivalcraft just select it in the worlds list, select 3 dots at bottom right and use upload button
6. In the EditSC import screen, select "Choose file", select "Dropbox" in the Browse menu, and select the world from Apps > Survivalcraft.

Tell Kaalus you want integration with the Files app. If this is implemented, you will be able to do this with only step 6 but select Survivalcraft instead of Dropbox in the sidebar.

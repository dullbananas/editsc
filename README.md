# EditSC
EditSC is a browser-based Survivalcraft world editor. It uses Python to serve the application, and it uses TypeScript and Elm on the frontend. It is currently incomplete, but you can try importing a world here (i develop directly on this server so it might not always be working): https://dulldev.pythonanywhere.com/editsc/

There are videos of this [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhj4sng6bHuoX4eQDRqA2-vyvc9alPFxj)

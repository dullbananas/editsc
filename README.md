# EditSC
EditSC is a browser-based Survivalcraft world editor. It uses Python to serve the application, and it uses TypeScript and Elm on the frontend. It is currently incomplete, but you can try importing a world here (i develop directly on this server so it might not always be working): https://dulldev.pythonanywhere.com/editsc/

You can discuss this and find out more by joinint [this Discord server](https://discord.gg/jTySXuh) and seeing the #edit-sc-project channel

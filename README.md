# EditSC
EditSC is a browser-based Survivalcraft world editor. It uses Python to serve the application, and it uses TypeScript and Elm on the client side. It is currently incomplete, but you can try importing a very small world here (i develop directly on this server): https://dullgo.pythonanywhere.com/editsc/
